# Mut1ny Detector models
Execution code examples for all Mut1ny different detector (https://shop.mut1ny.com) deep neural 
network models. These are example codes for using Mut1ny's detector neural network models in 
different languages and with different frameworks

There are examples for ONNX models (using ONNX Runtime (https://github.com/Microsoft/onnxruntime) in
 
 * C++ (requires FreeImage https://freeimage.sourceforge.io)
 * Python (requires Pillow)
 * C#
 
 including preprocessing and post-processing steps
