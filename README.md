# Mut1ny's Deep Learning resources
Execution code examples for Models on Mut1ny's Deep Learning Resources store (https://store.mut1ny.com) deep neural network models
These are example codes for using Mut1ny's different deep neural network models in different languages and with different frameworks

There are examples for ONNX models (using ONNX Runtime (https://github.com/Microsoft/onnxruntime) in
 
 * C++
 * Python
 * C#
 
 including preprocessing and post-processing steps
 
 There are examples for PyTorch/Torchscript models (https://pytorch.org) in
 * C++
 * Python
